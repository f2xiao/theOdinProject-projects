## About

This repository contains my solutions for the projects in the Full Stack JavaScript Path by
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?).
The Odin Poject is a great resources for learning programming by yourself. However, I prefer well structured courses which provides a better leanring curve (such as the [MDN front-end developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer) and [The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)). The Odin Project's projects are mainly used as supplementry exercises to practice and imporve coding skills through building projects.
